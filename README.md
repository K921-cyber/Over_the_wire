## 🧩 Introduction

Welcome to my **OverTheWire Walkthrough Repository!**

This repo contains detailed, beginner-friendly **writeups and solutions** for the [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), designed to help you **learn cybersecurity hands-on** through real Linux-based Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

Each level teaches valuable skills in:
- 🧠 Command-line mastery  
- 🔍 File system exploration  
- 🔑 Privilege escalation  
- 🕵️ Information gathering  
- 💣 Exploit understanding
